Packages
-------------
-> package logically organize classes into
   modules
-> so that classes can be accessibe/modified
   module wise.
-> can also provide visibility scopes
   to the classes in the package
-> package keyword must be the fist line
   in the java class

Ex: com, com.cts, com.cts.ecart
    com.cts.ecart.service (non db)
    com.cts.ecart.dao (only db)

import p1.*; // only imports all classes of p1 package only
import p1.p2.*;//only imports all classes of p2 package only
import p1.p2.p3.*;//imports only classes of p3 package only

How can you make sure a class is fully encapulated?
-> define all properties as private
-> create setters and getters as public
    -> setter : takes argument. but will not return
    -> getter : will not take argument, but will return value

    private int empId;
    // setter ...
    public void setEmpId(int empId){
        this.empId=empId
    }
    //getter
    public int getEmpId(){
    return empId
    }
