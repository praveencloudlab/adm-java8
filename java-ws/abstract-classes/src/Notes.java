     *  abstract class
     *  --------------------
     *  -> abstract class is a method specification which contains zero or more abstract methods and
     *     concrete methods
     * -> abstract methods can not have body. its only specification / declaration
     * -> we can not create object to abstract class. But we can create reference variable to it.
     * -> the reference of abstract class can stor all its implementation class objects
     * -> the refrence of abstract class can access all methods of a super class and overridden methods
     *    of subclass
     * -> the reference of abstract can not access individual methods of subclass
     * -> If subclass of an abstract class not implementing any one of abstract methods, then
     *    that subclass must be declare as 'abstract'
     *
