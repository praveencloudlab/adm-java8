     *  Interface
     *  -------------
     *  -> interface is an method specification which contains zero or more only
     *     abstract methods
     *  -> by default very variable in interface is public static and final
     *  -> every method in interface by default public abd abstract
     *  -> interface object can not be created, but ca create reference variable
     *  -> reference of interface can be used to store, all its implementation / subclass
     *     objects
     *  -> the reference of interface can be used to access all the methods in the
     *     interface, and overridden methods of its subclasses
     *  -> the interface reference can not be used to access individual methods of
     *     subclasses
     *
     *  Notes:
     *  1. interface can extends to another interface
     *  2. interface can not implements another interface
     *  3. interface can extends more than one interface at at time
     *  4. class can extends to another class only
     *  5. class can  implements interface
     *  6. class can not extends to interface
     *  7. class can not extends more than one class at a time
     *  8. a class can implement more than one interface at a time
     *  9. a class  can not be defined as both 'final and abstract'
     *
     *
     *
     *   when to use abstract classes and interafces?
